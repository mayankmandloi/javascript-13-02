The summary of the film is as follows.\r\nIn this era where one's ego holds the optimum position and its all about I-Me-Myself, how often do we say ''Jab Tum Kaho'' to someone? Making someone happy has always been considered and portrayed as a deed that actually fulfills your own happiness, however it appears to be an old school notion now as those days seem to have faded awayOr do we still have it in us to make others happiness our source of happiness ? This is not a story, its a JourneyA journey of a man unfolds as he transforms from being a Jovial, happy-go-lucky and an optimistic person to a subdued quiet man who becomes mechanical person who lives for the sake of it where there is no ray of hope or no hint of happiness in his life. A journey of a man who was full of life to mere existence in life. Its a journey of what Love stands for this man, from defining love only as lust he discovers the true deep connotation of the emotion behind the word and in the process he also discovers and finds himself. Running over a span of 10 years, this beautiful Journey is truly about the pious emotion of love, from being a word to being an emotion. A journey of what love means and stands for over the years of growing and discovering oneself and breaking the barrier of thoughts and going above and beyond.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__-ro4nMVQQ","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/__-ro4nMVQQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Drama","RatingCount":1,"Rating":0.0,"TotalCriticReviews":0,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"2/26/2016","ReleaseDateAvailable":1,"ReleaseYear":2016,"Runtime":0,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"http://images.cinemalytics.com/movie/CD471EAA100FF5CC9EF7D9EFF6E94772.jpg","PosterReleased":1,"LastUpdateTime":"10/31/2016 2:50:43 PM"},

Madhura is an RJ, a voice that the whole city knows and recognises but with a stranger's face. Set in a world dotted by people who are misfits much like our protagonists, it is finally food that will bind these characters. The film is based in Goa and it goes on floor in May 2016.","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Romance","RatingCount":1,"Rating":0.0,"TotalCriticReviews":0,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"1/1/2016","ReleaseDateAvailable":1,"ReleaseYear":2016,"Runtime":0,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"http://images.cinemalytics.com/movie/C32C17A1FA43872D01E249C312BF1AB6.png","PosterReleased":0,"LastUpdateTime":"10/24/2016 6:06:05 PM"},

Aakash Oberoi (Amit Sadh), the founder of a private mixed martial arts league, is encouraged by his father to hire an Indian wrestler to salvage the league's popularity. He travels to Haryana to make an offer to Sultan, who bluntly refuses and says that he has completely retired from wrestling. In search of the reason behind his retirement, Aakash confronts Sultan's close friend Govind (Anant Sharma), who narrates how Sultan's career began.\r\n\r\nEight years ago, Sultan fell in love at the sight of Aarfa Hussain (Anushka Sharma), a state-level wrestler and the daughter of a local wrestling coach. Although she was initially cold towards him, Aarfa accepted Sultan as a friend. When he began to proclaim that she was his girlfriend, she rejected him by stating that she wishes to marry an accomplished wrestler like herself. Determined to win her respect, Sultan dedicated himself to intense training and ultimately won a state-level wrestling tournament, as well as Aarfa's love. The two were married and became recognized wrestlers, representing India in various international tournaments like the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. When the two were announced as finalists for the Olympic Games, Aarfa discovered that she was pregnant. She gave up her childhood dream of winning an Olympic gold medal for India, which was then fulfilled by Sultan. To her surprise, Sultan's accomplishment made him arrogant, and he acted conceitedly during a press conference. Even though Aarfa informed him that she was nearing her due date, Sultan left to win another international wrestling championship. Upon returning, he was shocked to know that his newborn son had died due to severe anemia. The baby had a rare O negative blood type, identical to Sultan's, whose absence deprived the child of a donor. Angered, Aarfa decided to leave Sultan and reside with her father. Depressed from losing his wife and child, Sultan began to fundraise to open a blood bank in Haryana.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, Aakash asks Sultan to join his league and promises that the tournament's prize money will fulfill his dream of opening a blood bank. Sultan agrees despite having become unfit and tired, and travels to Delhi, where Aakash introduces him to freestyle mixed martial arts coach Fateh Singh (Randeep Hooda). After two months of training with Fateh, who is a former international champion, Sultan manages to regain his physique and learns how to wrestle freestyle. Although he initially struggles in his first fight, Sultan defeats the opponent using his own iconic wrestling style. He soon becomes a nationwide sensation once again by winning a series of matches and gains Aarfa's support in the process. During the semi-final round, Sultan wins the fight but is severely injured and has to be hospitalized. The doctor informs Aakash that Sultan should not fight again lest his injuries become fatal. Aarfa arrives at the ward and reconciles with Sultan, motivating him to continue fighting. During the final match, Sultan overcomes his pain to defeat his opponent and ultimately wins the tournament. Reunited with his wife, Sultan opens a blood bank using the prize money and Aarfa resumes wrestling. A few years later, she gives birth to a baby girl, whom Sultan begins to train as a wrestler.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPxqcq6Byq0","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wPxqcq6Byq0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":1,"Rating":4.0,"TotalCriticReviews":5,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"7/6/2016","ReleaseDateAvailable":1,"ReleaseYear":2016,"Runtime":170,"Budget":700000000,"Revenue":5836700000,"PosterPath":"http://images.cinemalytics.com/movie/8AE1B98F0BBC20E6685B15A608CA4F3D.jpg","PosterReleased":1,"LastUpdateTime":"9/13/2016 11:45:27 AM"},

Together with ostentatious crew that is led by Tayaji (Satish Kaushik), he indulges in uncontrolled consumption of cocaine. Tommy, also known as 'Gabru', is popular for his adrenaline-pumping songs that both were written with the help of and are about intoxication. However, Tommy has no qualms about his songs glorifying violence and drug-addiction. However, his frequent bouts of drug-snorting cost him his contract and land him in jail. In prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs. Realizing that his songs have adversely and negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. Few days later, Tommy engages in an altercation with Tayaji and accidentally shoots him, injuring his ear. This causes Tayaji to send Tommy and his crew to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.\r\n\r\nWorking on a farm is an unnamed Bihari migrant (Alia Bhatt), frequently called \"Bauria\" by a co-worker in the fields, whose dreams of playing national level hockey for the country were shattered. She came to work as a slave for a local patriarchal family who use agriculture as a front for drug peddling. One night, while roaming around in the farm, she finds a packet. Upon tearing open its contents and tasting it, she realizes that it is some kind of drug, and hence, resolves to sell it. Her search for a potential buyer lands her in great trouble as she is chased and captured by a gang of drug peddlers. They forcibly keep Bauria at their place where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs and prostituted to several men including police officers from the local police force. Some weeks later, Bauria manages to escape from the house.\r\n\r\nIn this neighboring town also lives Preet Sahni (Kareena Kapoor), a doctor-cum-activist who runs a rehabilitation center. Sartaj Singh (Diljit Dosanjh) is a class-two policeman attached to the town's station who knows about the smuggling of drugs his seniors are allowing on a large scale. But when it affects his family, his brother, Bali (Prabhjyot Singh), overdoses on Chaand (locally-made drug) and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. She educates Sartaj about the drug problem and partly accuses him for his brother's state. Together, they decide to find the root cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nAppearing before his audience in the concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead his/her life, his fans try to admonish him, and start throwing bottles at him. Tommy gets angry and urinates on the crowd.Making a run out of the concert to save himself from the crowd's angst, Tommy goes and hides inside a dilapidated structure. There he meets Bauria and together they start sharing their stories. However, the next day, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang who had kept her imprisoned.\r\n\r\nPreet has been working in Punjab actively with drug abuse survivors and their families. She runs her own clinic in the area where she operates a residential rehab center. With help from a reformed Sartaj who discovers that his own brother is hooked to a locally-made drug, manages to find that the antagonist behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Vikrant who has flourished with the support of MP Maninder Brar. Sartaj and Preeti go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the Parliamentarian and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj develops feelings for her and asks her out to which she reciprocates willingly. However, one night, after returning from work, she is apprehended and fatally stabbed by Balli, who was being treated against his wish at her rehab center. The policemen who come to investigate her murder also come across her report.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of the drug mafia, Sartaj is questioned by his senior about the report. At the same time, Tommy, who is on the run from the police and has been searching for Bauria, jumps and enters the enclosure, alerting everyone including Vikrant and the senior policeman. He fatally hits Vikrant with his hockey stick and tries to make a move upstairs. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Sartaj grabs his senior's service revolver and shoots everyone but Tommy. He then rushes inside the house to get his brother Balli, who is being held captive by Vikrant's wife. He shoots her and frees Balli, while Tommy goes upstairs and helps Bauria beat her captors.

In all this Kabir does not say anything to her and returns back to their home. He starts packing his bag to leave for Chandigarh. Kia sees the gift given by Jaya Bachchan in which was a letter which said that to be a man not working but handling the house is a brave choice but to be a wife of such a man is a harder choice. The letter said that Kabir was indeed lucky to have Kia as his wife. Kia's mother also tells her that she was jealous of Kabir's fame and one who earns in the family is bound to be jealous when the other starts receiving fame.

{"Id":"f0becbbc","ImdbId":"tt5286444","OriginalTitle":"Neerja","Title":"Neerja","Description":"The film opens with Neerja Bhanot (Sonam Kapoor), 22 years old, arriving (late) for a house party. She's loved by everyone, the life of every party. Later that evening her mother (Shabana Azmi) expresses concern once again about Neerja's job as a flight attendant and suggests Neerja return to her old job of modeling. Neerja likes her job and is driven to the airport by her boyfriend Jaideep (Shekhar Ravjiani). (Her mother is not totally thrilled about this either.) Neerja's colleagues love Jaideep, he adores her and gives her an advance birthday present.\r\n\r\nNeerja reflects on her brief and unhappy arranged marriage. Her former husband was a professional in Doha, Qatar. He constantly harangued and abused Neerja over dowry. (It is revealed that Neerja's family had made it clear there would be no dowry, but the husband had expected something anyway.) He also abused Neerja as she could not cook or clean. She eventually returned home to honor a modeling contract. He sent back a humiliating letter attacking her parents about dowry, her lack of domestic skills and suggesting that she had better bring something (money) back or not come back at all. She broke off with him and landed a highly competitive job with Pan Am.\r\n\r\nAs Neerja boards Pan Am 73 (Sep 5, 1986) it is revealed that a terrorist group has planned to hijack the plane in Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai and lands in Karachi where the terrorists board the plane disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat. They reveal themselves and hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit and the American pilots escape through the overhead hatch and run into the terminal. (The plane cannot be flown.)\r\n\r\nWhen an Indian American inadvertently reveals himself (to be an American) the terrorists grab him and shoot him dead before the Pakistani negotiators. The terrorists try to locate the radio engineer among the passengers but Neerja bravely signals him to remain quiet. Later the terrorists ask the flight attendants to collect the passports so as to locate the Americans and hold them hostage. Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports but skilfully avoid any American passports by kicking them under the seats or down the trash chutes. Soon the terrorists locate a British citizen and use him for negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe Pakistan negotiators inadvertently reveal the name of the radio engineer (a Pakistani); he is now located and roughly brought into the cockpit to start the radio and begin the negotiations. The Pakistanis stall for time. The terrorist leader chastises the other, younger, terrorist who has begun roughing up the passengers and molesting the attendants (including Neerja). Angered by his public embarrassment the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots the radio engineer and, in full defiance of his leader, screams wild threats over the radio. The terrorists are confused; the leader only wants to complete the mission but the younger man is now only serving his own rage. Pakistani air control is still negotiating but they are slowly losing control and time and the terrorists are getting agitated by the minute.\r\n\r\nSome 17 hours later the plane loses auxiliary power and the lights go out. Despite Neerja and the other attendants trying to explain this as a normal airplane reaction, the terrorists believe the power was cut by the Pakistan armed forces who will soon storm the plane.

The story synopsis is as follows...\r\n\r\nPrabhu Selvaraj (Tamil version)/Adi Tomar (Hindi version) (R. Madhavan) is a failed boxer, who despite being very talented, fell victim to the dirty politics in the boxing association. Ten years later, he is a coach for women's boxing teams but is extremely angry and frustrated with the partiality in selection. Due to his rift with the association head Dev Khatri (Zakir Hussain), he is falsely charged for sexual harassment and transferred to Chennai. Despite the very poor infrastructure, Prabhu manages to find talent in a road side fish seller Madhi (Ritika Singh), who he notices while thrashing the judges during her sister's tournament.\r\n\r\nIgnoring Madhi's elder sister Luxmi (Mumtaz Sorcar) who has been boxing for 8 years, Prabhu offers to train Madhi for few hours daily. But the two don't get along, due to Prabhu's ruthless training methods and Madhi's aggressive nature. As a result, Madhi intentionally loses a local level match. Prabhu later asks Luxmi and Madhi's parents, Saamikannu (Kaali Venkat) and Damayanthi (Baljinder Kaur), to send them to stay in hostel with him, so their daughters can work hard on training. Madhi misunderstands him, but later regrets when she finds out that Prabhu has sold his bike to buy new training equipment for her. Madhi then dedicatedly starts training with Prabhu and develops feelings for him. On a day of a qualifying match, she reveals her feelings to Prabhu, and he promptly rejects her. During the warm-up before the match, a now jealous Luxmi injures Madhi's hand, causing Madhi to lose. Angry Prabhu thinks that Madhi lost intentionally again and throws her out of training camp.\r\n\r\nDev takes advantage of the situation by calling Madhi to Delhi for a cultural exchange tournament and makes her fight with a heavy weight Russian boxer, who knocks out Madhi in a few seconds.

Dev takes revenge by getting her arrested for false theft charges.\r\n\r\nPrabhu comes to the rescue and bails her out.
